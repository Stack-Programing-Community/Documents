# String Notation

Stack's string notation is using parentheses to surround.
You might think why is it strange notation, usually quotation.
Of course, that has justifiable reason.

Stack hasn't code block, in place of use string.
code block should be able to nest, So string should be it too.

Take for example, the notation is like below.
```stack-lang
(text)
```
